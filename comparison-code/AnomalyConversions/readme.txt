Anomaly Conversion Files

Included Scripts:
EccenToMeanAnomaly.m
EccenToTrueAnomaly.m
MeanToEccenAnomaly.m
MeanToTrueAnomaly.m
TrueToEccenAnomaly.m
TrueToMeanAnomaly.m

Description:
This set of files provide a set of conversions between
the True Anomaly, Mean Anomaly, and Eccentric anomaly.
The scripts assume that the anomaly value inputs and
outputs are in radians.

The scripts were all written using Octave, which is
very similar to Matlab, but is free. The scripts should
also work in Matlab with a few minor modifications:
 - Convert all instances of ## to %
 - Convert all instances of endfunction to end

These scripts are free to use and are distributed with
the understanding that they have not been independently
verified and come with no warranty. Basically, it's up
to you to do the verification and you are using them at
your own risk.

However, if you do have questions on their usage, e-mail
me at orbitnerd@gmail.com and I will attempt to help you
out.
